# Development Progress Log

## Project Setup - Initial Structure
- Created base project folders
- Set up directory structure according to implementation plan
- Added base script files for core systems
- Created placeholder scene files
- Set up .gitignore for version control

## Project Configuration
- Set main scene to main.tscn
- Configured window settings (1280x720 resolution with proper scaling)
- Set up custom user directory ("PetCompanion") for save data
- Optimized rendering settings:
  - Set mobile rendering method for cross-platform compatibility
  - Configured anti-aliasing options (MSAA level 1)
  - Optimized shadow mapping (1024 for desktop, 512 for mobile)
  - Disabled high-quality reflections for performance
  - Applied appropriate texture compression (ETC for Android, PVRTC for iOS)
- Added mobile-specific configurations:
  - Set sensor_landscape orientation
  - Configured touch input (emulate touch from mouse)
  - Disabled mouse emulation from touch for better mobile experience
- Configured iOS-specific settings:
  - Set minimum deployment target to iOS 13.0
  - Added required permission descriptions
  - Configured status bar and home indicator hiding
- Set up physics for mobile optimization (30 physics FPS)
- Created default environment resource with optimized lighting settings
- Verified export presets for all target platforms:
  - Windows (x86_64) with appropriate texture compression
  - macOS (universal)
  - Android (arm64-v8a and armeabi-v7a)
  - iOS (arm64)
- Updated architecture documentation with detailed configuration specifications

## Core Systems Implementation
- Implemented GameManager singleton:
  - Created a comprehensive state management system
  - Implemented pause functionality
  - Added scene transition mechanism
  - Created placeholder save/load system
  - Added debug mode for easier testing and development
  - Developed a signal-based communication system for game state changes
- Created a test scene to validate GameManager functionality
- Registered GameManager as an Autoload in project settings

## Resource System Implementation
- Implemented ResourceManager singleton:
  - Created a comprehensive resource caching system
  - Implemented both synchronous and asynchronous resource loading
  - Added resource unloading functionality
  - Implemented resource preloading for batch operations
  - Added memory usage tracking and cache cleanup mechanism
  - Developed a performance monitoring system with detailed statistics
  - Optimized for mobile platforms with automatic cache trimming
- Created a test scene to validate ResourceManager functionality:
  - Added UI for testing different resource loading methods
  - Implemented performance timing for load operations
  - Created visualization for loaded texture resources
  - Added detailed cache statistics display
- Created test resources for validation testing
- Wrote comprehensive documentation for the ResourceManager test
- Verified ResourceManager is properly registered as an Autoload
- Fixed compatibility issues with Godot 4.4:
  - Updated signal emissions to use .emit() method
  - Used proper type annotations
  - Implemented correct callback binding with .bind() method
  - Updated timer connections to use new signal syntax

## Next Steps
- Create SettingsManager functionality (Step 5)
- Design character data structure (Step 6)
- Create and integrate 3D character models (Step 7)
